<h1> Files in python </h1>


Data is usually stored on a disk and saved in
files which are held in
containers called directories or folders.
File systems are usually organized in
a tree structure with directories
and files nested under their parents. 

<h2> Reading Files </h2>

<h3>Opening files :</h3>
```python3
>>> file = open('new.txt')
```

<b>File Descriptor</b> is a token generated by the OS
that allows programs to do more operations with the file.
In Python, this file descriptor is
stored as an attribute of the files object.
The file object gives us a bunch of
methods that we can use to operate with the file.
Now, with this file object,
we can read the contents
of the file and print them to the screen. 

<h3>Reading Contents of the file :</h3>

``` python3
>>> file=open('hello.py')
>>> print(file.readline())
print("Hello world")
```
`readline()` reads a single line at a time from the file object.And if called again it would read the nextline

```python3
>>> file=open('usage_check.py')
>>> print(file.read())

import psutil
import shutil

def disk_usage(disk):
	du=shutil.disk_usage(disk)
	free_percentage = 100*(du.free / du.total)
	return free_percentage

def cpu_usage():
	usage=psutil.cpu_percent(1)
	return usage


if __name__ == '__main__':
	print('disk usage: ',disk_usage('/'),'percent')
	print('cpu usage: ',cpu_usage(),'percent')

>>> 
```

`file.read()` reads the complete file till the end of the file unlike `readline()` from the current location of the pointer
