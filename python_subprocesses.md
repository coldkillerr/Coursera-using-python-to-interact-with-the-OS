<h1> Python Subprocesses </h1>

Sometimes it's easier or faster to use a system command as part of our
Python script to accomplish a task, or use some functionality that doesn't exist
in the Python modules, neither built in or external.
For these cases, Python provides a way to execute system commands in our scripts,
using functions provided by the `subprocess` module.
