<h1> Processing Log Files </h1>

<h3> What are log files ? </h3>

The different events that happen in
programs that are running in
a system and aren't connected to
terminal are usually saved in log files.
Log files contain a lot of useful information,
particularly when you're trying to debug
a tricky problem that's happening on a computer.
