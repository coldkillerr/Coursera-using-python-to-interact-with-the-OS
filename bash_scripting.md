<h1> Bash Scripting </h1>

<h2> Basic Linux Commands </h2>

* `echo` is a command used to print messages to the screen
* `cat` is command for showing contents of files
* `ls` is the command to list contents of a directory
* `chmod` is a command to change permissions of a file
* `mkdir` command is used to create a new directory, 
* `cd` command is used change into new directory, 
* `pwd` is the command used  to print the current working directory. 
* `cp` command is used tocopy files from one directory to another.

  eg.
  ```shell
  $ cp ../qwikUnitTesting.pem .

  $ ls
  qwikUnitTesting.pem
  ```
  
  The dots `.` are shortcuts that we can
  use to refer to some special directories.
  The dot-dot `..` shortcut reverses a parent directory,
  the previous directory and the absolute path while
  the dot `.` shortcut reverses the current directory.
  So this command is copying the `qwikUnitTesting.pem`
  file located in the previous directory to this directory.
 
* `touch` command is used to create an empty file
